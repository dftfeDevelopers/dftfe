DFT-FE : Density Functional Theory With Finite-Elements 
=======================================================


About
-----

DFT-FE is a C++ code for materials modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory, developed by the [Computational Materials Physics Group](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg) at University of Michigan.
It is based on adaptive finite-element discretization that handles all-electron and pseudopotential calculations in the 
same framework, and incorporates scalable and efficient solvers for the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations. Importantly, DFT-FE can handle general geometries and boundary conditions, including periodic, semi-periodic and non-periodic systems. DFT-FE code builds on top of the deal.II library for everything 
that has to do with finite elements, geometries, meshes, etc., and, through deal.II on p4est for parallel adaptive mesh handling.
