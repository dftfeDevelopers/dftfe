DFT-FE : Density Functional Theory With Finite-Elements 
=======================================================


About
-----
DFT-FE is a C++ code for materials modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory. The origins of DFT-FE were in the  [Computational Materials Physics Group](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with Vikram Gavini, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering, as the principal investigator broadly overseeing the effort. The current development efforts span across the [Computational Materials Physics Group](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg) (Prof. Vikram Gavini, Dr. Sambit Das) at the University of Michigan and the [MATRIX lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/phanim/) (Prof. Phani Motamarri) at the Indian Institute of Science.

DFT-FE is based on an adaptive finite-element discretization that handles pseudopotential and all-electron calculations in the same framework, and incorporates scalable and efficient solvers for the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations. Importantly, DFT-FE can handle periodic, semi-periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions and general geometries. DFT-FE can be run on massively parallel many-core CPU and hybrid CPU-GPU architectures (tested up to ~200,000 cores on many-core CPUs and ~24,000 GPUs on hybrid CPU-GPU architectures). DFT-FE is capable of fast and accurate large-scale pseudopotential DFT calculations, reaching 50,000-100,000 electrons. 

Installation instructions
-------------------------

DFT-FE code builds on top of the deal.II library for everything that has to do with finite elements, geometries, meshes, etc., and, through deal.II on p4est for parallel adaptive mesh handling.
The steps to install the necessary dependencies and DFT-FE itself are described in the *Installation* section of the DFT-FE manual (compile doc/manual/manual.tex or download the release version manual [here](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe/blob/manual/manual-current-release.pdf)). 


Running DFT-FE
--------------

Instructions on how to run DFT-FE including demo examples can also be found in the *Running DFT-FE* section of the manual (compile doc/manual/manual.tex or download the release version manual [here](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe/blob/manual/manual-current-release.pdf)). Beyond the demo examples in the manual, we also refer to our [benchmarks repository](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe-benchmarks) which contains several accuracy and performance benchmarks on a range of system sizes.
