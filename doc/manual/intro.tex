\dftfe{} is a C++ code for materials modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
It is based on adaptive finite-element discretization that handles all-electron and pseudopotential calculations in the 
same framework, and incorporates scalable and efficient solvers for the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations. Importantly, \dftfe{} 
can handle general geometries and boundary conditions, including periodic, semi-periodic and non-periodic systems. \dftfe{} code 
builds on top of the deal.II library for everything that has to do with finite elements, geometries, meshes, etc., and, through 
deal.II on p4est for parallel adaptive mesh handling.

\label{sec:authors}
\dftfe{} is developed and maintained by the \href{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg/}{Computational Materials Physics
group at University of Michigan}, and the \href{https://sites.google.com/view/matrix-lab}{MATRIX lab, Indian Institute of Science}. The code is maintained by a group of principal developers, 
who manage the architecture of the code and the core functionalities. Developers with
significant contributions to core functionalities and code architecture in the past who are 
no longer active principal developers, are listed under principal developers emeriti. 
A subset of the principal developers and mentors are administrators. Finally, all contributors who have
contributed to major parts of the DFT-FE code or sent important fixes and enhancements are listed
under contributors. All the underlying lists are in alphabetical order.
