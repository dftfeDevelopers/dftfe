Some bullet points. To be expanded upon
\begin{itemize}
\item Adaptive meshing
\item Implement improved mixing strategies to decrease the number of SCF iterations.
\item Implement localization strategies to reduce computational cost for for large domain sizes (>1000 atoms).
\item Enriched FEM to reduce computational cost of all-electron calculations.
\item Post-processing tools.
\end{itemize}
