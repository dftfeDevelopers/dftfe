DFT-FE is hosted by the Computational Materials Physics group at University 
of Michigan (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg/), with Vikram Gavini, 
Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and
Engineering, as the principal investigator broadly overseeing the effort.
DFT-FE Authors is an all encompassing list of contributors to the DFT-FE code. 

The code is maintained by a group of principal developers, who manage the 
architecture of the code and the core functionalities. Developers with
significant contributions to core functionalities and code architecture
in the past who are no longer active principal developers, are listed under
principal developers emeriti. A subset of the principal developers and 
mentors are administrators. Finally, all contributors who have contributed
major parts of the DFT-FE code or sent fixes and small enhancements are listed
under contributors. All the underlying lists are in alphabetical order.
