DFT-FE is hosted by the Computational Materials Physics group at University 
of Michigan (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg/), with Vikram Gavini, 
Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering,
as the principal investigator broadly overseeing the effort.
'DFT-FE authors' is an all encompassing list of contributors to the DFT-FE code. 

The code is maintained by a group of principal developers, who manage the 
architecture of the code and the core functionalities. Developers with
significant contributions to core functionalities and code architecture
in the past who are no longer active principal developers, are listed under
principal developers emeriti. A subset of the principal developers and 
mentors are administrators. Finally, all contributors who have contributed to 
major parts of the DFT-FE code or sent important fixes and enhancements are 
listed under contributors. All the underlying lists are in alphabetical order
based on the last name.
